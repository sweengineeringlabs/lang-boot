# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Rustboot framework.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Title**: Brief, descriptive name
- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: What is the issue we're trying to solve?
- **Decision**: What is the change we're proposing?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or harder as a result?

## Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [001](001-security-module-organization.md) | Security Module Organization | Accepted | 2025-12-22 |

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the template structure
2. Number sequentially (e.g., 002, 003)
3. Use descriptive kebab-case filename
4. Update this index
